# AuthChallenge cell

`AuthChallenge` variable size cell contains an authentication challenge data for the handshake. It is sent from the accepting side
back to the initiating side after receiving the [Certs cell](certs.md).

## Payload

           Challenge            [32 bytes]
           [N] Methods          [2 bytes; big-endian unsigned integer]
                Methods         [2 * N bytes; big-endian unsigned integer]

It is sent from the responder to the initiator. Initiators must ignore unexpected bytes at the end of the cell.
Responders must generate every challenge independently using a strong RNG or PRNG.
The `Challenge` field is a randomly generated byte array that the initiator must sign (a hash of) as part of authenticating.
The methods are the authentication methods that the responder will accept.
